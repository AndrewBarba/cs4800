#### 1. Flows

###### a) What is the value of this flow?
Flow is equal to **18**

###### b) What is the minimum s − t cut?
Minimum s-t cut is **21**. Passing through (a,t), (c,t), (b,d) and (s,d)

###### c) Is this a maximum flow? Why, or why not?
This is **NOT** a max flow. The max flow is 21, which we know from finding the minimum cut in part a.

###### d) What are all the minimum s − t cuts in the flow network below on the left?
1. (s,u), (s,v) = 2
2. (s,u), (v,t) = 2
3. (u,t), (v,t) = 2

###### e) What is the minimum capacity of an s − t cut in the flow network below on the right?

#### Problem 2
The maximum flow is **13** via the minimum cut (s,a), (s,b), (c,b), (f,t)

#### Problem 3

#### Problem 4

#### Problem 5

#### Problem 6
